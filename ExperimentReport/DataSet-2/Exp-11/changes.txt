Change in dataset - Removing the star object images to reduce load on machine

CHanges to htmconfig.json

Change 1: 
"PotentialRadius": 30,
"LocalAreaDensity": 0.1	
"NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea": -1,
to 
"PotentialRadius": 10,
"LocalAreaDensity": -1
"NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea": 10,

Result: the micro corelation of the shapes are low and also less than the macro 
corelation between the images
