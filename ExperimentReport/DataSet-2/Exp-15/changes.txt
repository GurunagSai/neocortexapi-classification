Change in dataset - Removing the star object images to reduce load on machine

CHanges to htmconfig.json

Change 1: 
"PotentialRadius": 30,
"LocalAreaDensity": 0.1,
"ColumnDimensions": [
    32,
    32
  ],
to 
"PotentialRadius": 3,
"LocalAreaDensity": 0.1,
"ColumnDimensions": [
    64,
    64
  ],

Result: the micro corelation of the shapes are high and also less than the macro 
corelation between the images
