This file is the report of the dataset consisiting of images of Circle, Square and Trinagle and below are the observation points for the image classification output. 

1. Dataset1-exp1 is the result for the image classification for the above dataset without changing any htmconfig parameters
2. Dataset1-exp2 is the result for above dataset where htmconfig - Globalinhibition set "true". (macro correlation is high between images)
3. Dataset1-exp3 is the result for above dataset where maxboost = 1 (micro correlation is low and macro correlation between circle and square is high )
3. Dataset1-exp4 is the result for above dataset where maxboost = 20 (macro correlation of the images were high so it is not a valid update)
